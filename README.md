# Rap-surge

Rap Surge is a web application created for helping the users discover new up and coming hip-hop artists who are slowly creating a name for themselves. Users can use this web app to discover new artists or to see how their favorite rapper rank among other up and coming rappers. Rappers are ranked based on their music stream numbers from that previous month. The more streams you get, the higher you will be on the list. Rap Surge also provides the user with few facts about the artist, such as where they are from, their record label, and some of their top songs. A unique feature of Rap surge is providing a prediction of the future success of these new artists. The idea for the prediction section is the same as how sports athletes get compared to other veteran athletes when they first get drafted. Lastly, another unique feature of Rap Surge is the alumni page. Once an artist is no longer consider a "new artist," they are moved to the alumni section. In the alumni section, we keep our potential prediction we had when the rapper was new so users can see if they outgrew their potential or never lived up to it. This web application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
